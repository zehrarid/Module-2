# **Anomaly detection for guide sets**


## Module 1 of the MSstats-QC Framework
    
    
In this module we provide a tool for users to upload their datasets for anomaly detetion using the `Isolation Forest` algorithm trained using the solitude package.




#### **To use this tool and perform analysis you will need to have 2 data files:**

1. Input Data Set
2. (Optional) annotations



#### **Steps:**
1. Upload the Input Data Set
2. Set the Indices that will be used for computation and PCA visualtion 
  (make sure there are numeric only)

3. Set a `Contamination Factor` which signifies the percentage of dataset presumed to be anomalous.
(contamination factor used in the calculation of the threshold for Anomaly classification)

4. Press Plot! and see the results.




`To preview the workflow of the tool please take a look at the slides at the bottom of the module1-info page.`
